## Release

This project uploads a signed build to TestFlight on every push to `main` using Fastlane and GitHub Actions.
Later on there will be a manual workflow to create an app store & GitHub release.
The idea is that the latest version is always available on TestFlight and once we're happy with it, it can
be published to the App Store.

### Certificates for Fastlane

#### Initial Certificate setup

Please run the following locally: Firstly, install the Ruby dependencies:

```sh
cd ios
rbenv local 3.3.9 # or whatever version you want to run
# ensure your PATH is updated so the new version is picked up
rbenv exec gem install bundler
bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'
bundle install
```

Then publish the certificates to the dedicated privat GitHub repo

```sh
bundle exec fastlane match appstore \
      --git_url "${MATCH_GIT_URL:-git@github.com:SaturnFromTitan/pull-up-club-certificates.git}" \
      --app_identifier "${APP_BUNDLE_ID:-com.saturnfromtitan.pullupclub}"
```
